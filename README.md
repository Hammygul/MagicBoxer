Camera based measurement and smart packaging app. Essentially you either enter in the items with dimensions you want to ship, and the algorithm will determine the best sized box to fit it into. These boxes are all standard sizes with pricing included as well from USPS, UPS, and FedEx. 

The algorithm also visualizes in 3D how the items would fit into the package.

And incase you donâ€™t know the dimensions of your item you can use a camera based measuring function to get the dimensions.
